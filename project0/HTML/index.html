                <h3>A Couple of Topics that Fascinate Me</h3>
                <h4>Unity</h4>
                <p>Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Inc's WorldWide Developers Conference as a Mac OS-X exclusive game engine. As of 2018, the engine had been extended to support more than 25 platforms. The engine can be used to create three-dimensional, two-dimensional, virtual reality, and augmented reality games, as well as simulations and other experiences. The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming, such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering and construction.</p>

                <h4>Natural Language Processing</h4>
                <p>NLP is subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computer's and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation</p>  

                <h4>Blockchain</h4>
                <p>A blockchain, originally block chain, is growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".</p>
